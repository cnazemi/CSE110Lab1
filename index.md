### A little about me:

I'm a junior Computer Science student who is very passionate about software engineering and development. I'm seeking to apply the Computer Science skills developed during my experiences to help improve the world we live in.

This is my first Github Pages and to do it, I had to use git operations such as:
```
git clone
git add
git branch
git commit
git push
```

Using these operations help refresh my mind on version control! Anyways back to me...


My hobbies:
- Making apps
- Playing Basketball
- Watching Movies
- Making music
- Playing Rocket League


My priorities:
1. Family
2. School
3. Job
4. Extracurriculars


Life Goals:
- [x] Finish high school
- [X] Get into college
- [X] Take CSE 110!
- [ ] Graduate college

- [ ] Create my own software product
